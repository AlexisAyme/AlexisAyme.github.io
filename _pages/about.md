Since November 2024, I am postdoc in ENS Ulm (CNRS). I work within the CSD under the supervision of [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io). 
From 2021 to 2024, I was a PhD student in Machine Learning at Sorbonne University. I work within the department of statistics (LPSM) under the supervision of [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/index.html) (Sorbonne-Universit√©), [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) (Ecole Polytechnique) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io) (Ecole Polytechnique).
